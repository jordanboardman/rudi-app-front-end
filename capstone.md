# Capstone Project Requirements

## Requirements

This project is fairly open-ended, but this project should sell your technical skills to your colleagues and potential employers, so:

- It should demonstrate your technical expertise. If you want a job in web development, do a project that demonstrates your JavaScript + web stack skills.
- It should be ambitious: cookie-cutter todo apps or blog-apps probably won't help you land a great position.
- Start with the user-centered design process. This will help employers recognize your ability to set priorities in light of user needs!

**Heads-up**: If you don't participate in the capstone project (or make trivial contributions and disappear), you will not receive a DigitalCrafts certificate or become a DigitalCrafts graduate.

### Note

Your technical decisions are entirely up to you and your team. This is _your_ project. It's possible that you might choose a tech stack that is outside the Digital Crafts curriculum. Your instructor will do whatever they can to help you, but understand that they might not have expertise with that particular tech stack.

## Front-end Requirements

**_You must have a User Interface of some kind!_**

- You can build using any number of technologies. Here are some ideas:

  - React, React Native, ReactVR
  - Angular
  - Vue
  - Hardware based (motion, gesture, or voice activated)
  - Electron (HTML/CSS/JavaScript apps for the desktop)

- If you are building a UI for the browser:
  - `fetch` (or [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)) is recommended for AJAX.
  - It must be responsive.

## Backend Requirements

**_You must have a backend of some kind!_**

You are free to build a backend in any technology you choose! Node.js is the most obvious choice, but you are welcome to build using Python, Ruby, Java, C#/.NET, Go, Elixir, etc.

**_You must store data somewhere_**

- PostgreSQL is recommended, but you are free to use MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, or other ones.
- It is recommended that your site is protected with an SSL certificate. (Using Certbot is the best/free choice). Projects can be hosted locally for Demo Day, but will need to be deployed after.

## ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Important ⭐️⭐️⭐️

- You must provide DigitalCrafts with a **one-page summary** of your project with technologies used and your reasoning behind each. This should double as your _README.md_ on Github.
- Your final project must be publicly available on Github, include the README file, be hosted publicly, and featured on your portfolio.
- Your demo **must be recorded**. We will present these videos on Demo Day. There will _not_ be any live presentations.

### Demo Video (No more than 10 minutes)

- Present your project, think of it is as a "pitch."
- Every group member will need to speak, it's recommended to write a "script" for each person to read.

## Group Requirements

- One group member will take the role of **Scrum Master (SM)**
  - The SM will be the primary point of contact for each group.
  - We'll have morning stand-ups at the start of each lesson. The group's SM will report status during standup.
- One group member will be a **Product Owner (PO)** that is responsible for documentation for the application.
  - They will work closely with the SM to make sure the features are properly documented _as they're implemented_.

Both the PO and the SM can (and should) take an active role in development. However, these will be secondary contributions.

## ⭐️ Do and Do Not ⭐️

### DO

- Build the app around solving a problem.
- **COMMUNICATE** early, and often!
- Keep it SIMPLE! (No swords where butter knives will do!)

### DO NOT

- Shoehorn a problem into a tech stack.
- Fall in love with your code (because it's gonna change!).
- Work in a silo and forget to talk to people.

---

## Workflow Requirements

- Create github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
- Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests). You'll thank yourself when things break, and employers see how well you use Github.
- On a group, the reviewer **must** code review through Github and approve before the PR can be merged. If there are no comments, the code has spaghetti, or has difficult to read spots, code review didn't happen.
- You **must** use some kind of project planning software (such as [trello.com](http://trello.com/) or Github Projects).

## PR Rejection Criteria

- Does not fulfill feature
- Breaks other feature
- Inconsistent use of JavaScript language features (e.g. mixing `var` and `let`).
- Does not follow team's coding style/standards
- Copypasta (wholesale copying of another project without reference)
- Too many commits in a single PR (meaning too much to review)
- Code in a commit does not match commit message
- Commit message is vague

## Workflow Requirements

- You must still come to class on time
- Create github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
- Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests), even if you're working solo.
  - In a group, a reviewer must code review through Github and approve before the PR can be merged.
- Remember, employers may look at your code and pull requests with no descriptions and bad titles will look unprofessional.
- You must use some kind of project planning software (such as trello.com or Pivotal Tracker), even if you work solo.
